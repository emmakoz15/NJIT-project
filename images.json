1. Olympus Mons
Coordinates: 18.65° N, 226.2° E
The largest volcano and the tallest planetary mountain in the solar system, towering at about 22 km (13.6 miles) high.
2. Valles Marineris
Coordinates: 14.2° S, 276.0° E
The largest canyon system on Mars, stretching over 4,000 km (2,500 miles) long and up to 7 km (4.3 miles) deep.
3. Gale Crater (Curiosity Rover Landing Site)
Coordinates: 5.4° S, 137.8° E
A large crater where NASA's Curiosity rover landed in 2012, and it's famous for its complex geology and ancient lakebed.
4. Hellas Planitia
Coordinates: 42.0° S, 70.0° E
A massive impact basin, one of the largest and deepest on Mars, measuring about 2,300 km (1,400 miles) in diameter and 7 km (4.3 miles) deep.
5. Arcadia Planitia
Coordinates: 50.0° N, 210.0° E
A large plains area that is home to various tectonic features and is thought to have hosted ancient ice deposits.
6. Noctis Labyrinthus
Coordinates: 7.0° S, 265.0° E
A vast and complex system of deep, interwoven valleys, often referred to as the "Labyrinth of the Night," located near the western edge of Valles Marineris.
7. Elysium Planitia
Coordinates: 2.0° N, 154.0° E
A large volcanic region on Mars that includes the Elysium Mons volcano and is home to significant geothermal activity.
8. Cydonia Region (Face on Mars)
Coordinates: 40.8° N, 9.6° W
A famous region where the "Face on Mars" was discovered in the 1970s by NASA’s Viking Orbiter. The "face" is now thought to be a natural rock formation.
9. Utopia Planitia
Coordinates: 45.0° N, 105.0° E
A large, ancient impact basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars, believed to have once been a site of large-scale glaciation.
10. Schwabe Crater
Coordinates: 3.1° S, 148.1° E
A smaller but interesting impact crater located in the Elysium region, with complex geological features, likely due to ancient volcanic activity.
